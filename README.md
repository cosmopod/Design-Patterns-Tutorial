# Design Patterns Tutorial

The main purpose of this tutorial is to implement the design patterns described in pseudocode by Alexander Shivets in his book Dive Into Design Patterns. The entities of the examples have been changed to others more related to the field of video games. DIDPA is a book that I highly recommend because it not only describes the main design patterns but also investigates the motivations and cases in which they are necessary, which is, in my opinion, something crucial in the daily practice of every programmer.

It worth your money!
